# Evolution of bit

## Overview
Evolution of bit is a project for anyone who wants to practice Object Type Programming Design.

## Implementation
### Task
You need to do 4 things every day until reach the time you plan to stop.
* Write **source code**
* Write **tests** 
* Write **docs**
* Push to **github**

### Rules
Follow these rules when you implement this project.
* New source code that you add today **MUST** related to the code you write before. For example...
  * Call member functions that you create before
  * Extend Object that you create before
* The **ONLY** thing that in your main function is just only **life.Live()**

## Documents
1.**Day_1**: Print it selves name and what time is it.
2. **Day_2**: Add stdin sensor to life.

## Tool
I wrote Makefile so you can use it  to generate files and run code.

``` bash 
make gen args=[day_X]
```
