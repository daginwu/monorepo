# Evolution of bit

## Overview
Evolution of bit is a project for anyone who wants to practice Object Type Programming Design.

## Implementation
### Task
You need to do 4 things every day until reach the time you plan to stop.
* Write source code 
* Write tests 
* Write docs
* Push to github 

### Rules
Follow these rules when you implement this project.
* New source code that you add today **MUST** related to the code you write before. For example...
  * Call member functions that you create before
  * Extend Object that you create before
* The **ONLY** thing that in your main function is just only **life.Live()**
